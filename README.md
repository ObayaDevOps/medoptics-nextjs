This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

##  Headless CMS
For updating the webpage Content, we use Sanity, it can hold any type of content, Images, Text, Videos. Sanity will store the info and deliver it to the webpage quickly using its CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Link: https://www.sanity.io/

To Manage the account, log in to the admin panel add '/manage' to the end of the URL:

Link: https://www.sanity.io/manage

From here the key info to change is :
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=XXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production

These are crucial environment variable and can be changed locally in '.env.local' and on prod in Vercel Dashboard:  project -> settings -> environment variables

Remember, if the URL is changed the CORS will need to be added - Manage Panel :API -> CORS -> add new base url

To manage the Webpage Content, log into 'Sanity Studio': Just add '/studio' to the end of the URL or 'Admin Panel' in the footer

To Create something new on the webpage, you will need to add a 'Schema' to the codebase:

Note: That only 'document' type schemas will be available to create in the studio, all other lower-type schemas will need to be made of 'documents'
