This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

##  Headless CMS
For updating the webpage Content, we use Sanity, it can hold any type of content, Images, Text, Videos. Sanity will store the info and deliver it to the webpage quickly using its CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Link: https://www.sanity.io/

To Manage the account, log in to the admin panel:

To manage the Webpage Content, log into 'Sanity Studio': Just add '/studio' to the end of the URL or 'Admin Panel' in the footer

To Create something new on the webpage, you will need to add a 'Schema' to the codebase:
