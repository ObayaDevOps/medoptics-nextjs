      The three most common refractive errors are 

      Myopia – Near Sightedness
      Hyperopia –Far sightedness 
      Astigmatism – This is caused by an unevenness in the cornea which causes blurred vision at all distances 
      Presbyopia – This is simply the natural deterioration of the eye’s lens due to age. Typically it is noticeable by the time a person reaches their late 30’s as it is part of the natural ageing process.
      Prescriptions are written in units called diopters, they are measured in intervals of 0.25 steps and will either positive (+) or negative (-) 

      Sphere: If you suffer from Myopia( short sightedness) the prescription will be negative  (e.g -1.00, -1.25,-1.50), if you have hyperopia ( long sightedness)  the prescription will be positive (e.g +1.00, +1.25, +1.50). The higher the number the stronger the prescription. 

      Cylinder: If you have astigmatism, this simply denotes the amount of diopters (or degrees) between your corneas deepest and shallowest curves.

      No the reason you will need two different prescriptions for spectacles and contact lenses is because of the way each works with the eye. Contact lenses are in contact with the eye and spectacles sit further away,
       the prescription may be different because of the way your eye focuses through each lens.
